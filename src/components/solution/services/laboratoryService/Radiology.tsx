            Our Department of Radiology & Imaging combines state-of-the-art
            technology with world-class clinical expertise to deliver the best
            results. The Department of Radiology and Imaging has all the updated
            modalities necessary for diagnosis including cardiac and oncologic
            imaging, serving the purpose of screening, detection, obtaining
            diagnosis, guiding therapy, response assessment, and follow-up of
            post-treatment patients. <br />
            All modalities are connected by PACS (Picture Archiving and
            Communication System), and radiology reporting is done through the
            Radiology Information System (RIS) and is integrated into the Health
            Management System (HMS).
