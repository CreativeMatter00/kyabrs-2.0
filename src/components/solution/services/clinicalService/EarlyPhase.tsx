							Bioequivalence study
						</p>
						<p>
							Bioequivalence studies are very important for the development of
							pharmaceutical preparation in the pharmaceutical industry. Their
							rationale is the monitoring of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
							parameters after the administration of tested drugs. The
							importance of bioequivalence studies is increasing also due to the
							large growth in the production and consumption of generic
							products. <br />
							KYAMCH-BRS is capable of doing the bioequivalence study of any
							dosage form. KYAMCH-BRS Bioanalytical Laboratories provide method
							development, transfer, validation, and analysis of biological
							samples of study volunteers. <br />
							Data analysis for the confirmation of bioequivalence is performed
							using industry-standard WINNONLINÂ® software.
